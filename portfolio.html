	<h1 class="unnumbered" id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
		<p>Though my graphical work might not be relevant for this position, I
		decided to include it in this portfolio. I did this because despite
		professionally being a programmer I consider other forms of art a part
		of my lifelong work that has helped to shape me as well.</p>
	<h1 id="applications">Applications</h1>
	<ul>
	<li><p>An OpenGL application that serves for cell and mitochondria
	visualisation. I’ve included this application as a showcase of various
	shaders which include semi-transparent cell membrane rendering. Next
	shader implements metaball technique for mitochondria visualisation
	based on sphere centers and radii only, i.e., no mesh data is necessary
	for rendering. Renders from the application are available <a
	href="https://imgur.com/a/LrSzmXI">here</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Batch Image Processor</strong> – A console application
	written in C# encapsulating various image processing methods. The
	application enables the user to process multiple images in parallel and
	is designed to be easily extensible programmatically by user-defined
	image processing methods. The <a
	href="https://bitbucket.org/carbon1911/batch-image-processor/src/master/">source
	code</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Wood</strong> – The application generates different wood
	textures according to a selected type of tree. The <a
	href="https://bitbucket.org/carbon1911/wood/src/master/">source
	code</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>PA166-Tester</strong> – A teaching application with GUI.
	My contribution to the application consisted in the implementation of
	parametric active contours model along with GUI for an accessible user
	manipulation. Active contours are a tool similar to the magnetic lasso
	in Photoshop used for semiautomatic edge detection. The contribution was
	a result of my <a href="https://is.muni.cz/th/dvsk9/">bachelor
	thesis</a>. Screenshots from the application are available <a
	href="https://imgur.com/a/6q4AgoT">here</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>PALMS_CBIA</strong> – This is a GPU implementation of
	Piecewise Affine(-Linear) Mumford-Shah image segmentation method using
	CUDA/C++. GPU implementation was created as a counterpart to an existing
	CPU implementation. This is a relatively new scientific method and its
	GPU implementation might be considered the first of its kind. A simple
	benchmarking framework is included. The <a
	href="https://bitbucket.org/carbon1911/palms-cbia/src/master/">source
	code</a>.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<h1 id="games">Games</h1>
	<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Sticky Racing</strong> – A prototype of a cartoon RC cars
	racing game. Player can stick to the walls and perceive suburban house
	interior from previously unseen perspective. The game was developed in a
	team of three people. I was in charge of camera positioning, level
	design and kitchen assets modeling. Build is available at <a
	href="https://bitbucket.org/Ferdibrabec/sticky-racing/wiki/Home">this</a>
	link.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>The Planet Full of Monsters</strong> – A playable
	prototype of a board game developed in a team of three people. The game
	is for 4 players who find themselves cast away on the Planet Full of
	Monsters. The goal is to collect all parts of your crashed space ship,
	repair it and leave the planet while fighting the monsters controlled by
	other players. The fighting system is based on the Goofspiel. My role in
	the game was the gameboard and cards illustration as well as playtesting
	with the rest of the members of the team. The prototype with rules in
	czech language is available <a
	href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JIZBX4lccGoU7Kb-IViF4LhmyKpLbnXf?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Five in a Row</strong> – A classical browser game with a
	custom AI algorithm and an infinite game board. You can try to beat the
	AI <a href="https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xcicman/fiveinarow.html">here</a>.
	For the best experience use Google Chrome, please.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Couchsurfer</strong> – An early prototype of a 2D browser
	sidescrolling generative game. The player runs on an infinite sofa while
	trying to avoid various obstacles such as ashtrays, beer bottles and
	more. Obstacles are generated based on provided music track. We worked
	on this game in a team of three people and I was in charge of animation
	and assets design. The game is available <a
	href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RSZEQbq4w7XKfOCs8oF_G70EXgXwTlg_?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p></li>

	<h1 id="graphics">Graphics</h1>
	<ul>
	<li><p>A sculpted skull with extracted normal maps applied to a lowpoly
	model. Renders are available at <a
	href="https://imgur.com/a/pSWvFBS">this</a> link.</p></li>
	<li><p>Broken robot inspired by Dreadnought from Warhammer 40K universe
	and Combat Bot from Thief II: Metal Age. Renders are available at <a
	href="https://imgur.com/a/RXwNYcS">this</a> link.</p></li>
	<li><p>Simple lowpoly back alley with physically based light. Renders
	are available at <a href="https://imgur.com/a/RXwNYcS">this</a>
	link.</p></li>
	<li><p>Renders of a grunge back alley with a parked car along with a
	police car chase video. Some assets exported from GTA San Andreas were
	used in the video. Renders are available at <a
	href="https://imgur.com/a/bF5SMuV">this</a> link.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Colin Grey</strong> – Cartoon lowpoly figure with blue
	lit hair. Renders are available at <a
	href="https://imgur.com/a/QfDgNd6">this</a> link.</p></li>
	<li><p>Face retopology. Screenshots are available at <a

	<li><p>Various 2D graphics can be found at <a
	href="https://imgur.com/a/LZu86WI">this</a> link.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Back alley shootout</strong> – A collection of cartoon
	drawings of various persons with their nicknames. Available at <a
	href="https://imgur.com/a/7C0kjAm">this</a> link.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<h1 id="other">Other</h1>
	<ul>
	<li><p><strong>FAQ – Music Video</strong> – A music video for the song
	FAQ by Unstrung Harp. Though the output of this work is a video, it was
	created as a render from a PC application. The drawings are originals as
	well and for that sake it was difficult to put the work into one of the
	previous categories. WIP with assets, without the soundtrack available
