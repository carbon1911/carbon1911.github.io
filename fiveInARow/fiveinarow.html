					This is a Five in a row game. You need to build a continuous sequence of five stones
					before the computer. But beware because the computer won't let you do so that easily.
						
					<p>
						Maybe you've played Five in a row in your notebooks with your schoolmates while bored in a class.
						There you might have noticed that the gameboard is quasi-infinite or limited only by
						the notebook's dimensions which is a great difference between classical Gomoku game,
						which is played on 15x15 board, and Five-in-a-row as I knew it. The gameboard in this
						game is infinite as well. Use the arrows below the gameboard to move across it. Use
						"center" button to return back to the origin of the gameboard if the situation on it gets too messy.
						At the bottom of the screen you can see the instructions or the gameboard's offset.
					</p>
						
					<p>
						Good luck and have fun :)
